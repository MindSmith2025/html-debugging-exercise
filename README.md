# Mission: Debug Dex's Homepage! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíª

Hello, Code Detective!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help our friend **Dex the Duckasaurus**.

Dex tried to build his first-ever webpage to tell the world about himself. He was so excited that he made a few mistakes in his HTML code, and now his website is broken!

The page is supposed to look like this:

### Your Task

1.  Open the `index.html` file.
2.  Read the code carefully to find the bugs.
3.  Fix the mistakes so that the webpage looks exactly like the example above.
4.  Check your work by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

**Clues to look for:**
* Are all the tags spelled correctly?
* Does every opening tag have a matching closing tag?
* Are the image and link tags written correctly with the right attributes (`src`, `href`, `alt`)?
* Is everything in the correct section (`<head>` or `<body>`)?

Good luck, Code Detective! Dex is counting on you!
